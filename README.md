# Wodlog

## Description

When you arrive to the gym and check the WOD requirements for the day, sometimes you can't remember how many reps or weight you used last time you completed the same exercise (handstand pushups, for example).  Unfortunately, CrossFit gyms run a tight schedule, and I don't have time to estimate the last time I did handstand pushups, open the calendar and check which day featured handstand pushups, one by one.  Wodlog provides the most simple solution.  Type in the exercise you're searching for, and Wodlog will fetch a list of workouts where an instance of the exercise exists, sorted in chronological order.

* **Tech Stack** - Wodlog's frontend is built with React while the backend is built with Node/Express.
* **Status** - 1.0
